# sublime-files
An extracted backup of Sublime Text's files.

This was initially inspired by [sublime-default][] but that fell short of having the non-default included Sublime Packages. As a result, I decided to set up this repo.

[sublime-default]: https://github.com/randy3k/sublime-default

## Why?
When writing plugins and researching Sublime Text's API, it's very useful to have a hosted and sharable reference for code comments and forum posts.

## Is this legal?
I am not a lawyer but yes, it should be legal. Under Sublime Text's EULA, we can host "backups and archival [copies]" of Sublime Text.
